## Overview

It's my first project ever building a product.

My goal is simple: I want to help people to map their business metrics to their goals.
We have advanced tools to help you do this, but they are not easy to use.
We have tools like Google Sheets, Excel, but they are not easy to use.

Mapping of Metrics democratizes the process of mapping metrics to goals.
Now your Sales, Marketing, and Product teams can easily map their metrics to their goals.
No need fancy Data Analytics background.

## Key Features

- **Figma Plugin Integration**: Developed a custom Figma plugin that extracts design tokens such as colors, typography, and spacing values, and exports them in a format compatible with our codebase.
- **Code Generation**: Integrated an automated process that translates Figma components into React code using a combination of design tokens and pre-built component templates. This allowed developers to focus more on logic and less on repetitive UI coding.
- **Continuous Sync**: Established a CI/CD pipeline that continuously synchronizes design changes from Figma to the codebase, ensuring design updates are reflected instantly without manual intervention.
- **Scalable Design System**: Leveraged a design system that remains the single source of truth for both designers and developers, making it easy to maintain consistency even as the product evolves.

## Technologies Used

- **Django, PostgreSQL, Celery**: For building the back-end codebase.
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Shadcn/UI**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the challenges I faced is the authentication system. I wanted to the app to be accessible to everyone, so I decided to use django-tenant-schemas.
This is a great library, but it's not easy to use. Just like authentication, I had to ensure all components are "tenant aware". This way users can only access their own data.

This also allow user to have multiple "projects". User can create a new project, and start mapping their metrics to play around with their goals.

There are few more challenges, I faced. I won't go into details here, but it's related to:

- Backend
  - Authentication
  - Database schemas
  - Celery / asynchronous tasks
  - Testing and API documentation
- Frontend
  - Slicers for Context/Redux
  - API calls
  - Integrating React Flow / React Flow Editor
  - UI/UX

## Outcome

The project is stalled for now. I will very much continue working on this project. It just needs more time.
